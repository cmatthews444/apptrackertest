## By the end of class, the project will feature:
- The ability for a user to create a profile
- The ability for a user to quickly login
- View all applications
- A dashboard showing:
  - Things you need to follow up on
  - Jobs you tagged but haven't applied to yet
- Where you applied
- Opportunities
